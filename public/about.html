<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello there! I'm Aditya Ajit Sinhasane, and I'm excited to share my very first <b>HTML project</b>  with you.</p>
<p>I've always been <b>curious</b> about web development, and learning HTML is my first step in this exciting journey. While I'm still a beginner, I'm <b>passionate</b> about creating beautiful and functional websites.</p>
<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me playing outdoor game like cricket,kabaddi,volleyball etc.</p>
<p>This project is a showcase of my early progress, and I can't wait to continue improving my <b>skills</b> and exploring the world of web development.</p>
